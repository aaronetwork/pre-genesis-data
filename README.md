### Pre-genesis data

Data prepared before the network launch, which will be included in 
genesis.json - the configuration file from which the network starts
its work.

**The data includes addresses of:**
1. Participants in the airdrop
2. Participants in testing
3. Team addresses

The list of addresses that participated in the airdrop is available in a separate repository: https://github.com/aaronetwork/airdrop-data

If an address received the airdrop and participated in testing, rewards will be cumulative. If an address did not participate in the airdrop but joined the testing, the reward will be given only for testing and other activities, excluding airdrop rewards.

**The list of team addresses is provided below:**
